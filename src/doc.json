Initial attempts to censor the press were ruled unconstitutional, leading the government to employ judicial decisions as justification for limiting freedom of speech. Despite opposition concerns about democratic principles, the Congress government proceeded with the amendment, citing international examples of regulating speech to prevent abuse.

href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1218090/\" id=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_1\">Article 19(1)</a> of the Constitution of India guarantees six fundamental freedoms to every citizen of India. Though all of these six Fundamental Freedoms are not absolute. They contain certain restraints and exceptions within them which are postulated in Article 19(2) to 19(6).Â <br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/><b class=\"akn-b\">Freedom of Speech and Expression</b> - Article 19(1)(a) grants citizens the right to freely express their thoughts, opinions, and ideas. This includes the freedom to express oneself through speech, writing, printing, visual representations, or any other means. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right for the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign nations, public order, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation, incitement to an offense, or the sovereignty and integrity of Parliament.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>The first set of grounds, namely, the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States and public order are all grounds referable to national interest. Whereas the second set of grounds, namely, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation and incitement to an offense are all concerned with the interest of the society. However it is the constitutional obligation of the judiciary to ensure that the restrictions imposed by a law on the media are reasonable and relate to the purposes specified in Article 19(2).Because reasonable restrictions contemplated under the Indian Constitution brings the matter in the domain of the court as the question of reasonableness is a question primarily for the Court to decide. Freedom of speech and expression is a crucial right which is recognized by Article 19(l)(a), It has been held to be a basic and indivisible right for a democratic polity.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_2\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/456839/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/456839/\" id=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_2\">Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras</a> Â ,Patanjali Shastri, C.J. observed:âFreedom of speech and of the press lay at the foundation of all democratic organizations, for without free political discussion no public education, so essential for the proper functioning of the process of popular government, is possibleâThe expression âFreedom of pressâ is part of the ambit of article 19 and it means the right to print and publish without any interference from the state or any other public authority. But this Freedom, like other freedoms, cannot be absolute but is subject to well known exceptions acknowledged in the public interests, which in India are enumerated in Article 19(2) of the constitution.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Thus, in <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_3\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/671310/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/671310/\" id=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_3\">Prabhu Dutt v. Union of India</a> the Supreme Court has held that the right to know news and information regarding administration of the Government is included in the freedom of press. But this right is not absolute and restrictions can be imposed on it in the interest of the society and the individual from which the press obtains information. They can obtain information from an individual when he voluntarily agrees to give such information.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_4\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/125596/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/125596/\" id=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_4\">Bennett Coleman &amp; Co v. Union of India (1972),</a> the Honâble Supreme Court held that the freedom of the press embodies the right of the people to free speech and expression. It was held that âFreedom of the press is both qualitative and quantitative. Freedom lies both in circulation and in content.â<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the case of <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_5\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/\" id=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_5\">Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, 2015</a> Section 66A of the Information Technology Act was challenged. Under this section, there were several arrests which were made due to which a wide outrage was seen in society. The petitioners said that this Article is infringing the Freedom of Speech and Expression. The Supreme Court stroked down this provision saying that this provision is too vague and prone to misuse.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_6\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/438670/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/438670/\" id=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_1__ref_6\">State of U.P. v. Raj Narain (1975)</a>, the Supreme Court observed that the right to know is derived from the concept of freedom of speech. The Court further held that the people of this country have a right to know every public act, everything that is done in a public way, by their public functionaries.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Right to speak includes the right to not speak or the right to remain silent.

State of Kerala (1986)</a>, the Supreme Court upheld the right to silence of three students who were expelled from school because they refused to sing the National Anthem. The Court held that no person can be compelled to sing the National Anthem if he has genuine conscientious objections based on his religious belief. Hence, the right to speak and the right to express includes the right not to express and to be silent.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/><b class=\"akn-b\">Freedom to Assemble Peacefully</b> - Article 19(1)(b) ensures the right to peacefully assemble and hold public meetings or processions without arms. This right allows citizens to come together for various purposes, such as protests, demonstrations, or discussions.

Police Commissioner, Bombay (1972)</a>, the Supreme Court struck down a rule that empowered the police commissioner to impose a total ban on all public meetings and processions. It was held that the state could only make regulations in aid of the right of assembly of citizens and could impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order but no rule could be prescribed prohibiting all meetings or processions altogether.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/><b class=\"akn-b\">Freedom to Form Associations or Unions</b> -  Article 19(1)(c) guarantees the right to form associations or unions.

The extensive establishment of cooperatives was envisioned as one of the attempts to achieve social and economic justice and the equitable distribution of the advantages of progress. According to this Amendment, these societies are given constitutional status and are legally protected while also maintaining their autonomous or democratic functioning. The Constitution was amended to require that the states guarantee the autonomy of cooperatives, and as a result, state governments are now required to support the voluntary formation, autonomous decision-making, democratic control, and operation of cooperatives. The Act witnessed many changes such as modification in Part III of Article 19(1)(c) with the insertion of the words âor co-operative societiesâ, and the addition of Article 43B (working towards enhancing the co-Operative Societiesâ Voluntary formation, independent operation, and professional management) and Part IX B to the Indian Constitution. However, the 97th Amendment faced challenges in the High Court of Gujarat as the Parliament didnât ask for approval from the state legislatures before passing the bill. The ratification/approval is necessary for matters concerning states and since the cooperative societies are a part of the state legislature, ratification was required. On July 20, 2021, the Supreme Court of India declared the 97th Amendment Act Unconstitutional. According to the Supreme Court ratification from states was necessary to pass the amendment which didnât take place. The Supreme Court also said that the responsibility of Multistate Co-Operative societies is of the Centre while that of the State co-operative societies is of the state. As of the current scenario,  parts of the 97th Amendment on cooperatives are struck down.<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_9__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/97th-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\" href=\"https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/97th-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\" id=\"part_III__sec_19__wrapup__p_9__ref_1\">Also Refer</a>]</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>-The Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, repealed Article 19 (1) (f) and also took out Article 31(1) has been taken out of Part III and made a separate Article 300A in Chapter IV of Part XII.
